## What is Crit OS?

It's an x86_64 operating system written in rust. It's not meant to be used for anything, it's just a learning project.  
For now you can only print to the VGA Buffer and that's it. But hey atleast I have a nice interface for it.

## Run it

You need to have rust nightly installed. Then you can run it with:

```bash
cargo run
```
